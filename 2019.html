		    -Overall World Champion <br>
		    -1st Place Double Elimination (undefeated too...)<br>
		    -1st Place Double Seeding <br>
		    -2nd Place Seeding <br>

		    Thank you to Victor Wang for hosting and coaching us this year. We would not have been successful without his influence and support.
		    <br><br>
		    We're also saying goodbye to Team Captain and Head of Building Oscar Bjorkman as he graduates from the program.
		    We are sad to see him go and he will be missed. <br><br>
		    Here is a link to the winner's bracket finals against Uniq, where we epic-styled and blocked their disruptor.
		    It is recommended to watch the video in public with volume all the way up: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftVm0FZ7ly0&list=PLhhvYXiX-t7migFrGgWQjkIOwRjYBDJS9&index=6&t=0s">Ohhhhhhh</a>
