                So you've decided to come to our website. You may have been about to search for lactose intolerance 
                    remedies, or you may have decided to learn more about our team. Either way, while you're here, we should
                    fill you in on our team. <small>...haha shameless advertising...</small>
                <br/><br/>
                So who are we?
                <br/><br/>
                We are a group of bay area teens vying for a top spot at this year's <a href="http://new.gcer.net/">GCER</a> 
                    competition. We owe the existence of our team to the Los Altos Community Robotics conglomorate,
                    an informal community organisation dedicated to youth robotics in our area. They are run completely by
                    volunteer parents who decided to take time out of their busy days to help us. Thank you <strong>so much 
                    </strong> parents for your undying support for our team on an organisational and personal level. We would
                    not be where we are without their tremendous help.
                    
                    
                    Our favorite restaurant is Pho Vi Hoa
