                So you've decided to come to our website. You may have been about to search for lactose intolerance 
                    remedies, or you may have decided to learn more about our team. Either way, while you're here, we should
                    fill you in on our team. <small>...haha shameless advertising...</small>
                <br/><br/>
                So who are we?
                <br/><br/>
                We are a group of bay area teens vying for a top spot at this year's <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">here</a> 
                    competition. When we aren't meeting from 7-10pm most nights, we frequent our local Pho Vi Hoa,
                    a restaurant our team has essentially made a second meeting place. Every year, during our season 
                    commencement dinner, we decide on a theme for our team name and robot names. This involves intense 
                    brainstorming which usually ends indecisively and is the topic of discussion during our meetings for the
                    following weeks. This year we decided on PARTS. PARTS was intended to be an acronym describing our team — 
                    perhaps “<b>P</b>alo <b>A</b>lto <b>R</b>obo<b>t</b>ic<b>s</b>”? After coming to the realization that the 
                    acronym would be scarily similar to the ITEMS of last year, we dropped it. 
                    But we kept everything else, and we have adopted it as our identity. We are PARTS.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Our team is cheered on by our captain's cat, Stars, our unofficial team mascot. Stars is joined by a group
                    of excellent parents who support us through transportation, meals, part orders, and the general
                    emotional support that only a parent can provide when the robot stops working....
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We owe the existence of our team to the Los Altos Community Robotics conglomorate,
                    an informal community organisation dedicated to youth robotics in our area. They are run completely by
                    volunteer parents who decided to take time out of their busy days to help us. Thank you <strong>so much 
                    </strong> parents for your undying support for our team on an organisational and personal level. We would
                    not be where we are without their tremendous help.
               <br/><br/>
