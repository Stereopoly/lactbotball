                We are a group of bay area teens vying for a top spot at this year's <a href="http://new.gcer.net/">GCER</a> 
                    competition. When we aren't meeting from 7-10pm most nights, we frequent our local Pho Vi Hoa,
                    a restaurant our team has essentially made a second meeting place. Every year, during our season 
                    commencement dinner, we decide on a theme for our team name and robot names. This involves intense 
                    brainstorming which usually ends indecisively and is the topic of discussion during our meetings for the
                    following weeks. This year we decided on PARTS. PARTS was intended to be an acronym describing our team — 
                    perhaps “<b>P</b>alo <b>A</b>lto <b>R</b>obo<b>t</b>ic<b>s</b>”? After coming to the realization that the 
                    acronym would be scarily similar to the ITEMS of last year, we dropped it. 
                    But we kept everything else, and we have adopted it as our identity. We are PARTS.
