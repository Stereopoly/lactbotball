                    Our team is cheered on by our captain's cat, Stars, our unofficial team mascot. Stars is joined by a group
                    of excellent parents who support us through transportation, meals, part orders, and the general
                    emotional support that only a parent can provide when the robot stops working....
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We owe the existence of our team to the Los Altos Community Robotics conglomorate,
                    an informal community organisation dedicated to youth robotics in our area. They are run completely by
                    volunteer parents who decided to take time out of their busy days to help us. Thank you <strong>so much 
                    </strong> parents for your undying support for our team on an organisational and personal level. We would
                    not be where we are without their tremendous help.
