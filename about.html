                Our team is cheered on by our captain's cat, Stars, our unofficial team mascot. Stars is joined by a group of excellent parents who support us through transportation, meals, part orders, and the emotional support that only a parent can provide when the robot stops working....

                We owe the existence of our team to the Los Altos Community Robotics conglomerate, an informal community organization dedicated to youth robotics in our area. They are run completely by volunteer parents who decided to take time out of their busy days to help us. Thank you so much  parents for your undying support for our team on an organizational and personal level. We would not be where we are without their tremendous help.
